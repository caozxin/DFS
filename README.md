**Backtracking and DFS are similar concepts and essentially the same thing since in DFS you always "backtrack" after exploring a deeper node. 

We have two recursive calls dfs(root.left) and dfs(root.right), and we return based on the results from the recursive calls. This is also a divide and conquer algorithm. **
